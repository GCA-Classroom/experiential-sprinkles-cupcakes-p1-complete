# 🧁 Experiential Sprinkles Cupcakes: Part 1

Build the **Flavor of the Day** feature using basic JavaScript and the DOM.

## Quick Start
- Fork this repo and open in Codespaces (or clone and open with Live Server).
- Open `index.html` and `script.js`.

## What to Do
- In `script.js`, use the provided cupcake array + helper to choose today’s cupcake.
- Update the DOM:
  - set `src` on `#featured-cupcake-img`
  - set text of `#featured-cupcake-name`
- Test in the console with `console.log(revealFlavor())`, then reload to verify the image/name update.

## Optional Stretch
Support countries where the week starts on Saturday (e.g., Bahrain) by adjusting the selection logic.

## You’ll Practice
Arrays & objects → functions/conditionals → DOM selection & updates → console-based debugging.
